-- ds.page: Front-end Technologies

-- ds.h3: React.js

We use React.js for the front-end development, a popular JavaScript library for building responsive and dynamic user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows us to create modular and reusable UI elements.

-- ds.h3: HTML5 and CSS3

HTML5 and CSS3 are used for structuring and styling the app's web pages. They provide flexibility in creating visually appealing and interactive user interfaces.

-- ds.h3: JavaScript (ES6+)

We employ the latest JavaScript features (ES6 and beyond) to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code for the front-end.
